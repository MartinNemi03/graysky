# Graysky

Graysky is a Bluesky client written in React Native. ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§

## Getting Started

You'll need pnpm, and some sort of simulator or device to run the app on.

```bash
pnpm install
```

> Weird side step - you need to go to `apps/expo/app.config.ts` and delete the `extra` field which has an expo project id in it. Sorry, I'll fix this later.
> You may also need to delete Sentry, or else provide your own key

Build the dev client using EAS:

```bash
cd apps/expo
pnpm build:dev-client
// or
pnpm build:android:dev-client
```

For iOS, unzip the `graysky.zip` file that appears, then install `Graysky.app` to your simulator:

```bash
eas build:run --path=Graysky.app
```

For Android, install the APK to your device:

```bash
eas build:run --path=graysky.apk
```

You can then start the expo server with:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Android local APK builds

- Install Android Studio, and the Android SDK
- Install Oracle Java 11 JDK
- Make Gradle faster in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx20g -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=2g
org.gradle.parallel=true
org.gradle.configureondemand=true
org.gradle.daemon=false
org.gradle.caching=true
```

- [Create a signing key in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key)
- Build it with: `eas build --platform android --profile production-apk --non-interactive --local --output="./foo.apk" --wait`
- Sign it with: `/Users/alice/Library/Android/sdk/build-tools/33.0.0/apksigner sign -ks sideload.jks foo.apk`

## iOS local IPA builds

### ZSH/Bash

```
SHORT_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
eas build --platform ios --profile production --non-interactive --local --output="./$SHORT_SHA.ipa" --wait && say "Build finished"
eas submit --platform ios --path="./$SHORT_SHA.ipa" --wait && say "Submitted to TestFlight"
```

### Fish shell

```
set SHORT_SHA (git rev-parse --short HEAD)
eas build --platform ios --profile production --non-interactive --local --output="./$SHORT_SHA.ipa" --wait; and say "Build finished"
eas submit --platform ios --path="./$SHORT_SHA.ipa" --wait; and say "Submitted to TestFlight"
```
