# Graysky

Graysky is a Bluesky client written in React Native.

TestFlight: https://testflight.apple.com/join/8Q1M4gwt

Play Store beta: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/dev.mozzius.graysky

## Getting Started

You'll need pnpm, and some sort of simulator or device to run the app on.

```bash
pnpm install
```

> Weird side step - you need to go to `apps/expo/app.config.ts` and delete the `extra` field which has an expo project id in it. Sorry, I'll fix this later.

In the `/apps/expo` directory, build the dev client using EAS:

```bash
cd apps/expo
pnpm build:dev-client:ios
// or
pnpm build:dev-client:android
```

You can then start the expo server with:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Android local APK builds

- Install Android Studio, and the Android SDK
- Install Oracle Java 11 JDK
- Make Gradle faster in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx20g -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=2g
org.gradle.parallel=true
org.gradle.configureondemand=true
org.gradle.daemon=false
org.gradle.caching=true
```

You can now either run `pnpm build:android` to build the app and automatically submit it with `eas submit`, or if you want to sign a build manually you can do the following:

- [Create a signing key in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key)
- Build it with: `eas build --platform android --profile production-apk --non-interactive --local --output="./foo.apk" --wait`
- Sign it with: `/Users/alice/Library/Android/sdk/build-tools/33.0.0/apksigner sign -ks sideload.jks foo.apk`

## iOS local builds

```
pnpm build:ios
```
