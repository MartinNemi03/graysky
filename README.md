# Graysky

Graysky is a Bluesky client written in React Native. ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§

> I've only tested this on iOS, your mileage may vary on Android.

## Getting Started

You'll need pnpm, and some sort of simulator or device to run the app on.

```bash
pnpm install
```

You can then start the expo server with:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

(Note: this is a shortcut for `expo start --ios`)
