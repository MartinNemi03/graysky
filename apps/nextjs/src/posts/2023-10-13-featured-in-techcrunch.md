# Graysky was featured in TechCrunch!

> [TechCrunch: Bluesky gets its first third-party mobile app with Graysky, launching later this month](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/12/bluesky-gets-its-first-third-party-mobile-app-with-graysky-launching-later-this-month/)<br/>Sarah Perez, 12<sup>th</sup> October 2023

Who would've thought that my little side project would end up being featured in TechCrunch? I'm still in shock!

A highlight from the article:

> Graysky lets you see everyone’s likes, not just your own — similar to Twitter/X. It will also support the ability to send GIFs powered by Tenor that are backward compatible with the official app, and supports inline translation within threads.

That's right: GIFs are coming to Bluesky! Here's [Bluesky's first GIF](https://bsky.app/profile/graysky.app/post/3kblf44f4ib2t) - best viewed on Graysky.

Thanks to Sarah Perez for the great writeup!

Remember, Graysky is launching on the 21<sup>st</sup> of October - you can [pre-order it on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/graysky/id6448234181) if you're interesting in a powerful new Bluesky client (that has GIFs).

See you on the Skyline!
