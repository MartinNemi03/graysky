# Introducing Graysky Pro

With the release of Graysky v1.2.0, I'm excited to announce the launch of Graysky Pro, our new premium version!

Graysky Pro is a subscription that unlocks extra features on top of the free version of Graysky. In this first release, Graysky Pro unlocks the following features:

- **Better translations**: Translate posts into your preferred language using [DeepL](https://deepl.com). DeepL offers much better quality translations than the default Google Translate.
- **Custom themes**: Set a custom theme colour for Graysky - choose from a selection of pre-defined colours, and make Graysky your own.

We've got a lot more features planned for Graysky Pro in the near future, including:

- **Custom app icons**: Choose from a selection of app icons to customise the look of Graysky on your home screen.
- **Polls**: Create polls in your posts, and vote on polls created by others.
- **Analytics**: View analytics for your posts, including likes, reposts, and engagement.

## How do I get Graysky Pro?

You can subscribe to Graysky Pro by going to the "Graysky Pro" tab in the drawer menu (press your profile picture in the top left corner of the screen to open it). From there, you can choose to subscribe monthly or yearly.

After that, it will unlock an additional area in the settings menu where you can enable the features you want to use.

## How much does it cost?

Graysky Pro is available for approximately $4.99 per month (depending on region). You can also save money by subscribing for a year at a time, which costs approximately $49.99 per year.

## What about the free version?

To be clear - it's completely optional, and the free version of Graysky will always be available. I'm committed to keeping the basic Bluesky experience (a.k.a. what the official Bluesky app offers) free, and only paywall extra features. Examples of these would be cosmetic features like custom themes and app icons, or features that require additional server resources, like polls and analytics.

## What's Graysky?

Graysky is a third-party client for the social media platform Bluesky. Built with React Native, Graysky aims to provide a fast, reliable, and beautiful experience for Bluesky users on both Android and iOS. Graysky is completely free to use, and will always be open source. Check it out on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/graysky/id6448234181) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.mozzius.graysky).

See you on the Skyline!
