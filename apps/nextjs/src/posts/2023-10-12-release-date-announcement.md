# We're almost ready to go!

Graysky is now available to [pre-order on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/graysky/id6448234181), with the launch date set for October the 21<sup>st</sup>!

I'm so excited to finally be able to share Graysky with you all. I've been working on this app for almost 6 months now, and I'm so proud of what I've been able to build. I hope you all love it as much as I do. It's been a crazy ride - thousands of you have signed up to be beta testers, and I've received hundreds of bug reports and feature requests. I'm so grateful for all of your support.

## What's Graysky again?

Graysky is a third-party client for the social media platform Bluesky. Built with React Native, Graysky aims to provide a fast, reliable, and beautiful experience for Bluesky users on both Android and iOS. Graysky is completely free to use, and will always be open source.

## What's next?

I'll be making some more exciting accouncements in the run-up to launch, so stay tuned!

See you on the Skyline!
